** Problem Statement
Show that the following are convex:

1. The set of $n \times n$ Toeplitz matrices
2. The set of monic polynomials of the same degree
3. The set of symmetric matrices

** Solution
Begin by defining what a complex set is:

#+begin_quote
A set $S$ is convex if for any two points $p,q \in S$, then all points of the form

$$
\lambda p + (1 - \lambda)q
$$

for $0 \le \lambda \le 1$, are also in $S$.
#+end_quote

*** 3.1: Toeplitz
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:3.1
:END:

Begin by defining what a Toeplitz matrix is

#+begin_quote
A Toeplitz matrix is a diagonal-constant matrix, which means all elements along a diagonal have the same value. For a
Toeplitz matrix $A$ we have $A_{ij} = a_{i-j}$ which results in the form

\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b & c & \cdots \\
e & a & b & \cdots \\
f & e & a & \cdots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
#+end_quote

Consider Toeplitz matrices $P$ and $Q$ of dimension $n \times n$ as let $S$ be the set of $n\times n$ Toeplitz matrices. Lets now apply the definition of the convex set:

$$
\lambda P + (1 - \lambda)Q
$$

There are two operations being applied to the matrices: addition

#+begin_quote
If $A = [a_{ij}]$ and $B = [b_{ij}]$ are matrices of the same size, then their sum $A+B$ is the matrix obtained by
adding the corresponding elements of the matrix $A$ and $B$.
#+end_quote

and multiplication of a matrix by a number

#+begin_quote
If $A = [a_ij]$ is a matrix and $c$ is a number, then $cA$ is the matrix obtained by multiplying each element of $A$ by
$c$.
#+end_quote

Therefore, we can make the statements

- Any Toeplitz matrix multiplied by a scalar is also Toeplitz
- Any two $n \times n$ Toeplitz matrices being added together is also Toeplitz

The following statement can then be made: The set of $n \times n$ Toeplitz matrices is convex.

$$
\lambda P + (1 - \lambda)Q \in S
$$

*** 3.2: Monic Polynomials of Degree $n$
Begin by defining what a monic polynomial is

#+begin_quote
A polynomial is monic if the coefficient of the highest order term is 1.
#+end_quote

Suppose $p$ and $q$ are monic polynomials of degree $n$ and $S$ is the set of all monic polynomials of degree $n$. It
can be written

$$
\lambda p(x) + (1 - \lambda)q(x) \in S
$$

Expanding the above gives

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{l}
\lambda (x^n - ax^{n-1} + \cdots + bx + c) + (1- \lambda)(x^n + dx^{n-1} + \cdots + ex + f) \\
= 2 \lambda x^n + (a+d x^{n-1}) + \cdots \\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

Dividing by $2\lambda$ produces another monic polynomial of degree $n$. Therefore, the set is convex, i.e $\lambda p(x) + (1 - \lambda)q(x) \in S$.

*** 3.3: Symmetric Matrices
Define what a symmetric matrix is

#+begin_quote
A matrix $A$ is symmetric $\iff A = A^T$.
#+end_quote

Similarly to [[#sec:3.1][3.1]],

- Let $P$ and $Q$ are $n \times n$ symmetric matrices
- $S$ is the set of $n \times n$ symmetric matrices
- Any symmetric matrix multiplied by a scalar is also symmetric
- Any two $n \times n$ symmetric matrices being added together is also symmetric

Therefore, $S$ is convex because $\lambda P + (1 - \lambda)Q \in S$.

** Problem Statement
The set of even integers can be represented as $2\mathbb{Z}$. Show that $|2\mathbb{Z}| = |\mathbb{Z}|$. Similarly show that there are as many odd
integers as there are integers.

** Solution
Let $S$ and $T$ be two different sets. $T$ and $S$ have the same cardinality if there is a bijection $f$ from $S$ to
$T$. Therefore, we need to show $f : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow 2\mathbb{Z}$. Let the mapping $f(n)$ be defined as

\begin{equation*}
f(n) = 2n
\end{equation*}

It now needs to be shown that $f(n)$ is both one-to-one and onto. To show that $f(n)$ is one-to-one begin by defining
how to show a mapping is one-to-one

#+begin_quote
A function $f$ from $A$ onto $B$ is one-to-one if each element of $B$ has at most one element of $A$ mapped into it.
That is, $f(x) = f(y)$, then $x = y$.
#+end_quote

From this if we suppose $f(a) = f(b)$, then $2a = 2b$ so $a=b$. Thus, $f$ is one-to-one. Now we need to show $f$ is
onto. Begin by defining onto

#+begin_quote
A function is onto if each element of $B$ has at least one element of $A$ that is mapped into it. That is, $\forall b
\in B$ there is an $a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$.
#+end_quote

Take $b = 2n$ for some $a$, then $f(n) = 2n = b$ which shows that $f$ is onto. Therefore, $f(n)$ is a bijection and
$|\mathbb{Z}| = |2\mathbb{Z}|$.

Similarly, for the odd we need to show $f : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow 2\mathbb{Z}+1$ is a bijection. To show $f(n)$ is one-to-one let $f(a) = f(b)$,
then $2a + 1 = 2b + 1$, so $a=b$. To show $f$ is onto let $b = 2n+1$, then $f(n) = 2n + 1 = b$. Therefore, $f(n)$ is a
bijection and $|\mathbb{Z}| = |2\mathbb{Z}+1|$.

** Problem Statement
Show that $|(0,1]| = |\mathbb{R}|$.

** Solution
A simple way to go about this is to first show that $\big|[0,1)\big| = \big|[-\pi/2, \pi/2)\big|$. Suppose $f(x) = \pi x - \pi/2$. To show that
$f(x)$ is one-to-one

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{l}
f(x) = f(y) \\
\pi x - \pi/2 = \pi y - \pi/2 \\
\pi x = \pi y \\
x = y
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

Therefore, $f(x)$ is one-to-one. Now to show that $f(x)$ is also onto.

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{l}
f(x) = y \\
\pi x - \pi / 2 = y \\
x = y/\pi + 1/2
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

And because we know that $0 < x \le 1$ we can show that $x$ written above is in that range by saying

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{l}
- \pi/2 < y \le \pi/2 \\
- 1/2 < y/\pi \le 1/2 \\
0 < y/\pi + 1/2 \le 1\\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

Therefore, the function is also onto. Now to show that $\big|[-\pi/2, \pi/2)\big| = \big| \mathbb{R} \big|$. Let $g(x) = tan(x)$ it
can be shown that $tan(x)$ is always increasing.

#+begin_quote
*Fact*: If $g(x)$ is always increasing, then $g(x)$ is one-to-one.
#+end_quote

By taking the derivative of $g'(x) = sec^2(x) > 0$, therefore $g(x)$ is one-to-one. To show that $g(x)$ is onto, we will
use the intermediate value theorem

#+begin_quote
If $g(x)$ is continuous on an interval $[a,b]$, then $g(x)$ contains all the values between $g(a)$ and $g(b)$.
#+end_quote

Let the range of interest be $[-\pi/2 + \epsilon, \pi/2 - \epsilon]$. $g(x)$ is continuous within the range, therefore it obtains all
values $g(-\pi/2 + \epsilon)$ to $g(\pi/2 - \epsilon)$. If we let $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ then $g(x) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Therefore, $\big|(0,1]\big| = \big| \mathbb{R} \big|$.

** Problem Statement
Show that the intersection of a convex set is convex.

** Solution
Let $A$ and $B$ be two convex sets, and let $C = A \cup B$. Now let $p,q \in C$.

- If $p,q \in C$ then $p,q \in A$ and $A$ is convex
- If $p,q \in C$ then $p,q \in B$ and $B$ is convex
- Therefore $C$ must be complex

* 7
** Problem Statement
If $S$ and $T$ are convex sets both in $\mathbb{R}^n$, show that the set sum is convex.

#+attr_latex: :width 0.45\textwidth
[[./img/set-sum.png]]

** Solution
The set sum is defined as

$$
S+T = \{x: x = s + t, s\in S, t \in T\}
$$

Let $S$ and $T$ be convex sets and $S+T \in C$, let $s_1, s_2 \in S$ and $t_1, t_2 \in T$, and let $s = s_1 + t_1$ and $t = s_2 + t_2$, then

\begin{equation*}
\lambda s + (1 - \lambda)t \\
\lambda s_1 + \lambda t_1 + s_2(1-\lambda) + t_2(1-\lambda) \\
\lambda s_1 + (1-\lambda)t_1 + \lambda s_2 + (1-\lambda) t_2 \in C \\
\end{equation*}

Therefore, the set sum is convex.

** Problem Statement
Show that the polytope in $n$ dimensions is defined by

\begin{equation*}
P_n = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n : x_i \ge 0, \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1 \}
\end{equation*}

** Solution
Let is take the case of $n=1$ to start. Let $p = x1$ and $q = y_1$ then
using the definition used before we get

$$
\lambda p + (1 - \lambda)q
$$

Which must be convex because it is a single point. Now let $n=3$

\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{l}
\lambda p + (1 - \lambda)q \\
\lambda (x_1, x_2, x_3) + (1 - \lambda)(y_1, y_2, y_2) = (z_1, z_2, z_3)\\
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

Because $z$ must add up to 1, the set must be convex.

* 9
** Problem Statement
For the polytope $P_n$ of the previous problem, let $(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n) \in P_n$. Show by induction that

$$
n^2 \le \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{a_i}
$$

** Solution
Begin with the base case, $n=1$.
